# TetraCryptPQC_Nexus - Quantum-Secure Web3 Messaging Framework

## Overview

TetraCryptPQC_Nexus is a comprehensive post-quantum cryptographic framework designed for secure, future-proof messaging and identity verification. Built to resist both classical and quantum computing threats, it implements NIST FIPS 205/206 compliant algorithms including ML-KEM (Kyber) and SLH-DSA (Dilithium).

## Key Security Features

- **Quantum-Resistant Cryptography**: Military-grade encryption that defends against quantum attacks
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: StarkNet zk-STARK implementation for anonymous authentication
- **Decentralized Identity (DID)**: Self-sovereign identity management with quantum security
- **Hardware Security Module Support**: Enhanced key protection with optional hardware integration
- **Underground Network Support**: Resilient communication infrastructure for high-security environments

## Architecture Components

1. **Core Cryptography**: ML-KEM for key exchange, SLH-DSA for signatures, AES-256-GCM for symmetric encryption
2. **Secure Messaging**: E2E encrypted communication with perfect forward secrecy
3. **Identity & Authentication**: DID management with quantum-resistant verification
4. **AI-Driven Security**: Threat detection with anomaly monitoring and self-healing protocols
5. **Resilient Infrastructure**: Underground communication nodes with EMP hardening
